        <h3>Maternal Nutrition</h3>
        <p>During the prenatal stage, the baby's development is entirely dependent on the mother's nutrition. Adequate intake of essential nutrients is crucial for healthy growth.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasis on folic acid intake to prevent neural tube defects.</li>
          <li>Importance of iron for oxygen transport to the baby.</li>
          <li>Calcium for bone development.</li>
          <li>Protein for overall growth.</li>
          <li>Omega-3 fatty acids for brain and eye development.</li>
          <li>Hydration and a balanced diet are essential for both mother and baby.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fetal Sleep Patterns</h3>
        <p>Even before birth, the fetus experiences periods of rest and activity, developing early sleep-wake cycles.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fetuses spend a significant amount of time sleeping in the womb, up to 95% of the time in later stages.</li>
          <li>These sleep cycles are different from postnatal sleep and are characterized by periods of quiet and active sleep.</li>
          <li>Maternal activity and hormonal changes can influence fetal sleep patterns.</li>
          <li>Developing these early sleep patterns is a foundation for postnatal sleep regulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fetal Motor Development</h3>
        <p>Physical skills begin to develop in utero with early movements, reflexes, and the formation of muscles and bones.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Early movements can be felt by the mother as fluttering sensations.</li>
          <li>Reflexes like sucking and grasping develop before birth.</li>
          <li>Muscle and bone development progresses throughout gestation.</li>
          <li>Coordination begins to develop as the fetus moves within the womb.</li>
          <li>These early movements are essential for healthy physical development after birth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fetal Cognitive Development</h3>
        <p>Cognitive development begins with the formation of the brain and early neural connections, laying the groundwork for future learning and sensory processing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brain development is rapid during pregnancy.</li>
          <li>Early neural connections form, allowing for basic sensory processing.</li>
          <li>The fetus can respond to sounds from the external environment, especially the mother's voice.</li>
          <li>Exposure to language sounds in utero can influence later language development.</li>
          <li>Early learning and memory processes may begin before birth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Early Social & Sensory Development</h3>
        <p>While direct social interaction isn't possible prenatally, the fetus develops sensory awareness and responsiveness to the maternal environment, which are foundational for future social bonding.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The fetus can hear the mother's heartbeat and voice, as well as other external sounds.</li>
          <li>Responds to touch and movement within the womb.</li>
          <li>Begins to differentiate tastes through the amniotic fluid.</li>
          <li>These early sensory experiences prepare the baby for interaction with the world after birth.</li>
          <li>The bond between mother and baby begins to develop during pregnancy through these sensory exchanges.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="stage-content">
        <h3>Calendar of Feeding</h3>
        <p>During the prenatal stage, nutrition depends on the mother's diet and health. After birth, feeding schedules begin to form based on baby's cues and age-specific needs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0-3 Months:</strong> Feed on demand with breast milk or formula, typically every 2-3 hours. Recognize hunger cues and burp frequently.</li>
          <li><strong>Around 6 Months:</strong> Introduce pureed fruits, vegetables, and iron-fortified cereal once or twice a day. Offer small amounts of water.</li>
          <li><strong>7-12 Months:</strong> Offer a wider variety of textures and finger foods. Continue breast milk or formula alongside 2-3 meals and 1-2 snacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sleeping Hours</h3>
        <p>Prenatally, babies sleep up to 95% of the time. Establishing a healthy sleep schedule becomes essential after birth to support development.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0-3 Months:</strong> Highly variable sleep, around 14-17 hours total in short stretches.</li>
          <li><strong>3-6 Months:</strong> Sleep becomes longer, with fewer night wakings, around 12-15 hours total. Naps become more regular.</li>
          <li><strong>6-12 Months:</strong> Night sleep consolidates (11-14 hours total), typically with 2 naps daily. Establish a consistent bedtime routine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Physical Skills</h3>
        <p>Development of motor abilities like muscle formation, reflexes, and coordination begins during the prenatal stage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gross Motor:</strong> Holds head briefly (0-3m), rolls over (3-6m), sits (6-9m), crawls/pulls to stand (6-10m), first steps (10-12m).</li>
          <li><strong>Fine Motor:</strong> Grasps objects (0-3m), reaches for toys (3-6m), pincer grasp (6-9m), points (9-12m).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cognitive Thinking</h3>
        <p>Brain development and early neural connections are forming, laying the groundwork for future cognitive skills.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0-3 Months:</strong> Pays attention to faces and sounds.</li>
          <li><strong>3-6 Months:</strong> Shows interest in objects, develops object permanence.</li>
          <li><strong>6-9 Months:</strong> Explores objects, understands simple cause and effect.</li>
          <li><strong>9-12 Months:</strong> Understands simple instructions, looks for hidden objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Social Skills</h3>
        <p>While social interaction is limited prenatally, the fetus begins to respond to sounds, especially voices, preparing for future bonding.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0-3 Months:</strong> Smiles responsively, makes eye contact.</li>
          <li><strong>3-6 Months:</strong> Recognizes familiar faces, responds to name.</li>
          <li><strong>6-9 Months:</strong> Shows interest in social interaction, may show stranger anxiety.</li>
          <li><strong>9-12 Months:</strong> Plays simple games, may show separation anxiety.</li>
        </ul>
